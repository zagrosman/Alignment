## $\textcolor{green}{Installation\ guide}$

You can run the following commands to install Mview on your system. The Mview source codes can be obtained [developer website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-mview/files/bio-mview/mview-1.67/)

1. Save the archive to somewhere under your home folder then uncompress and extract it:
```
tar xvzf mview-VERSION.tar.gz
```
This creates a sub-folder mview-VERSION containing all the files.

2. Change to this folder.
3. Run the command:
```
perl install.pl
```
4. Then type `mview -help` to see the instructions. If it didn't work, you can run Mview by adding its installation path before `-help` flag:

```
/path/mview -help
```
